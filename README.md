This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

The project is a demo project for React Native. It utilizes React Native, Redux, React Navigation and Expo to create a basic fitness information tracking mobile app targeting both Android and IOS.

## Installation
`git clone` the project to local computer, and in the created folder, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Requirements
If using a real phone, for the development version to run correctly, [*Expo*](https://expo.io/) is required.

If using the simulator, either use Android Studio on Android or XCode IOS Simulator on IOS.

## Contribution
The project will likely not be continued in the future, therefore no pull requests will be accepted.
